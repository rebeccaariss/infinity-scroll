# Infinity Scroll
Infinity Scroll makes use of the Unsplash API, requesting 10 images at a time asynchronously using the Fetch API and rendering the images in such a way that the user never has to wait for photos to appear (creating a fluid and modern user experience).

## Configuration

1. Set up an application with [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers).
2. Copy `config.example.js` to `config.js`.
3. Replace the placeholder values in `config.js` with your own Unsplash API key.
4. Save the changes and run the application using a local development server such as [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
